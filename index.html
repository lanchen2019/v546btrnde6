            <p>
           Existing physical cloth simulators suffer from expensive computation and difficulties in tuning mechanical parameters to get desired
wrinkling behaviors. Data-driven methods provide an alternative solution. It typically synthesizes cloth animation at a much lower
computational cost, and also creates wrinkling effects that highly resemble the much controllable training data. In this paper we
propose a deep learning based method for synthesizing cloth animation with high resolution meshes. To do this we first create
a dataset for training: a pair of low and high resolution meshes are simulated and their motions are synchronized. As a result
the two meshes exhibit similar large-scale deformation but different small wrinkles. Each simulated mesh pair are then converted
into a pair of low and high resolution “images” (a 2D array of samples), with each image pixel being interpreted as any of
three features: the displacement, the normal and the velocity. With these image pairs, we design a multi-feature super-resolution
(MFSR) network that jointly train an upsampling synthesizer for the three features. The MFSR architecture consists of two key
components: a sharing module that takes multiple features as input to learn low-level representations from corresponding superresolution tasks simultaneously; and task-specific modules focusing on various high-level semantics. Frame-to-frame consistency
is well maintained thanks to the proposed kinematics-based loss function. Our method achieves realistic results at high frame rates:
12−14 times faster than traditional physical simulation. We demonstrate the performance of our method with various experimental
scenes, including a dressed character with sophisticated collisions.
